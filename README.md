# Booster

A Proof-of-Code and code walkthrough to demonstrate how to facilitate communication between userland applications and Windows kernel driver. This is a follow-up to [my last Windows Kernel development repository](https://github.com/whokilleddb/HelloWorldDriver) where I document my journey into Windows Kernel land - while giving extensive code walkthroughs. 

In this repository, we write a Client and a Driver which work together to boost a thread's Base Priority. 

# Usage

To send a signal to the Driver to increase the base priority of a thread, use the following command:

```
BoosterClient.exe <Thread ID> <Target Priority>
```

# Walkthrough

This part of the guide walks you through the Driver and Client code to explain the underlying concepts. First, we take a look into the driver itself which explores concepts like Handling Dispatch routines, Major Functions, etc, while the Client covers topics like how to use `CreateFile()` and `WriteFile()` to communicate with a driver. 

Also, we briefly touch upon IRQs but more upon that in future articles.

# The Driver

We will be breaking down this section by the different functions which constitute our driver, namely:

- [`DriverEntry()`](#driverentry) - This serves as an entry point when the driver is loaded by the system
- [`BoosterCreateClose()`](#boostercreateclose) - This function handles Create/Close dispatch routines issued by the Client
- [`BoosterWrite()`](#boosterwrite) - This function handles Write dispatch routine 
- [`BoosterUnload()`](#boosterunload) - This function is called when the system unloads our driver

## DriverEntry

Looking at the `DriverEntry()` function, it has the following code:
```c
NTSTATUS DriverEntry(PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject, PUNICODE_STRING _RegistryPath) {
  // Set major functions to indicate supported functions
  DriverObject->DriverUnload = BoosterUnload;
  DriverObject->MajorFunction[IRP_MJ_WRITE] = BoosterWrite;
  DriverObject->MajorFunction[IRP_MJ_CREATE] = DriverObject->MajorFunction[IRP_MJ_CLOSE] = BoosterCreateClose;

  // Create a device object for the client to talk to
  PDEVICE_OBJECT device_obj = NULL;
  UNICODE_STRING device_name = RTL_CONSTANT_STRING(L"\\Device\\Booster");
  NTSTATUS status = IoCreateDevice(DriverObject, 0, &device_name, FILE_DEVICE_UNKNOWN, 0, FALSE, &device_obj);
  if (!NT_STATUS(status))	return status;
  device_obj->Flags |= DO_BUFFERED_IO;

  // Create symbolic link
  UNICODE_STRING symlink_name = RTL_CONSTANT_STRING(L"\\??\\Booster");
  status = IoCreateSymbolicLink(&symlink_name, &device_name);
  if (!NT_SUCCESS(status)) {
    IoDeleteDevice(device_obj);
    return status;
  }

  return status;
}
```

There are three major parts to the function - Setting the major functions to indicate the functions our driver supports, creating a device object for the client to interact with, and finally creating a symbolic link for the client to call `CreateFile()` on. 

The first part of the code sets the necessary function pointers:

 - First, set the `DriverUnload` member of the `DriverObject` which points to the unload routine.
 - Then we set the `MajorFunction` members. The `MajorFunction` array contains a list of function pointers that serve as entry points for the Driver's dispatch routines. These indicate the functionalities supported by the driver. In our case, we support three routines:
	- `IRP_MJ_CREATE`: A routine to deal with requests sent by the client when it tries to open a handle to the Device object 
	- `IRP_MJ_CLOSE`: A routine to deal with requests sent by the client when it tries to close the handle to the Device object 
	- `IRP_MJ_WRITE`: A routine to deal with requests sent by the client when it tries to transfer data to the driver using operations like `WriteFile()` or `NtWriteFile()`

For the sake of simplicity, we will point the major functions indicated by `IRP_MJ_CREATE` and `IRP_MJ_WRITE` to the same dispatch routine. But, why do we need to specify these functions in the first place? [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-create) specifies that we need to specify these functions to handle the Create/Close Dispatch routines so that the clients can have a handle for it, and, in turn, uses functions like `WriteFile()` which need a handle to be passed in as one of the parameters. 

Next up, we create a Device for the Client to interact with. We use the `RTL_CONSTANT_STRING` macro to initialize a `UNICODE_STRING` with the full path name of the device. We create a device called `Booster` in the `\Device` [object directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Manager_(Windows)), which is where devices are usually created.

Following that, we use the `IoCreateDevice()` to go ahead and actually create the device. The parameters passed to this function are as follows:

| Parameter | Value | Description |
| --|--|---|
|`PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject` | `DriverObject` | Pointer to the driver object for the caller. In our case, we get the pointer as a parameter for the `DriverEntry()` function.|
|`ULONG DeviceExtensionSize` | 0 | Specifies the driver-determined number of bytes to be allocated for theÂ [device extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/device-extensions)Â of the device object. This allows us to attach extra information to the devices, in case we need to. In our case, we dont have any such special requirements.|
|`PUNICODE_STRING DeviceName` | `&device_name` |Pointer to the null-terminated device name Unicode string.|
|`DEVICE_TYPE DeviceType`|`FILE_DEVICE_UNKNOWN`| Indicates the type of device - since we do not confront to the usual predefined driver types, we specify `FILE_DEVICE_UNKNOWN`.|
|`ULONG DeviceCharacteristics`| 0| Specifies additional information about the driver's device - since we have no special permissions, we set it to 0. |
|`BOOLEAN Exclusive` |`FALSE`| Specifies if the device object represents anÂ [exclusive device](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/). Most drivers set this value toÂ **FALSE**. |
|`PDEVICE_OBJECT *DeviceObject` |`&device_obj`| Pointer to a variable that receives a pointer to the newly createdÂ [DEVICE_OBJECT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_device_object)Â structure. |

If the function runs successfully - we should have a valid Device object. This address to this device can also be found at the first index of the linked list pointed by `DeviceObject` field of `DriverObject`. 

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/images/3devobj.png)


Next up, we also create a symbolic link for the device so that the client can easily access it. We use the `IoCreateSymbolicLink()` function to create a symbolic link to our device called `\??\Booster` where `\??`Â is a "fake" prefix that refers to per-user Dos devices. 

However, if the `IoCreateSymbolicLink()` fails, we need to delete the previously created device object as if `DriverEntry()` function returns something other than `STATUS_SUCCESS`, the unload routine is never called - so we don't have any opportunities to clean up after ourselves. If we do not delete the device object - we will leak the device object.  

Finally, we return the valid `NTSTATUS` from the function signifying that the `DriverEntry` routine was complete. 

----

## BoosterCreateClose

This function is responsible for handling Create/Close dispatch routines - and has the following code:

```c
NTSTATUS BoosterCreateClose(PDEVICE_OBJECT _DriverObject, PIRP Irp) {
  ...      
  ...

  Irp->IoStatus.Status = STATUS_SUCCESS;
  Irp->IoStatus.Information = 0;
  IoCompleteRequest(Irp, 0);
  return STATUS_SUCCESS;
}
```

The function takes in two parameters - the pointer to the `DriverObject`, and a pointer to an [`IRP`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_irp) structure that represents anÂ I/O request packet. For our driver, we won't need anything fancy - so we would just let the operation complete successfully. To do it, we need to do a couple of things:

- First, we set the final status of the request as `STATUS_SUCCESS` by assigning that value to the `Status` component of the [`IO_STATUS_BLOCK`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_io_status_block). The `IO_STATUS_BLOCK` structure stores status and information before calling `IoCompleteRequest()`[more on that in a moment].
- Next up, we set the `Information` field of `IoStatus` to indicate that we do not pass any additional information to the Client. For example, for Write/Read, this field can define the number of bytes that were written/read and return that information to the caller. Since for Create/Close we don't have any such requirements, we set it to 0. 
- Finally, we complete the request with [`IoCompleteRequest()`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iocompleterequest) indicating that we have completed the I/O request and returns the IRP to the I/O manager. We pass two parameters to the function - the `Irp` structure pointer as well as the value for the priority boost for the original thread that requested the operation. Since we complete the IRP synchronously, we set it to 0.
- Finally, we return the same status as the one we put in `Irp->IoStatus.Status`. However, we cannot just something like `return Irp->IoStatus.Status` because after the `IoCompleteRequest()` function is called - the value stored in the address might change.

With this, we complete the function allowing us to open and close handles to the driver. Onto the next ðŸš€

## BoosterWrite

The code we have written so far can more or less be considered as boiler template - something which we would find unchanged across a lot of future work, but this function is the crux of the whole driver.

```c
NTSTATUS BoosterWrite(PDEVICE_OBJECT _DriverObject, PIRP Irp) {
	UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER(_DriverObject);

	ULONG info = 0;
	PETHREAD thread = NULL;
	NTSTATUS status = STATUS_SUCCESS;
	PIO_STACK_LOCATION irp_sp = IoGetCurrentIrpStackLocation(Irp);
	if (irp_sp->Parameters.Write.Length < sizeof(ThreadData)) {
		status = STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL;
		goto io;
	}

	ThreadData * p_data = (ThreadData*)(Irp->AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer);
	if (p_data == NULL || p_data->TargetPriority < 1 || p_data->TargetPriority > 31) {
		status = STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER;
		goto io;
	}

	HANDLE h_tid = ULongToHandle(p_data->ThreadId);
	status = PsLookupThreadByThreadId(h_tid, &thread);
	if (!NT_SUCCESS(status)) goto io;

	KPRIORITY _old_priority = KeSetPriorityThread(thread, p_data->TargetPriority);
	KdPrint((DRIVER_PREFIX "Changed priority from %ld to %d", _old_priority, p_data->TargetPriority));
	ObDereferenceObject(thread);
	info = sizeof(ThreadData);

io:
	Irp->IoStatus.Status = status;
	Irp->IoStatus.Information = info;
	IoCompleteRequest(Irp, 0);
	return status;
}
```

The first thing we do is get a pointer to the IRP's stack with [`IoGetCurrentIrpStackLocation()`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iogetcurrentirpstacklocation) - essentially returning a pointer to a [`IO_STACK_LOCATION`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_io_stack_location) structure which contains information associated with each IRP (more about these in some future article). Another important point to note before we proceed is to look into the `BoosterCommon.h` header file which defines the `ThreadData` structure as follows:
```c
typedef struct _ThreadData{}
```

This structure will be shared by the Driver and the Client to pass information back and forth. 

One important thing to do is to make sure that we got the right data from the Client and enforce the necessary checks on the Driver side of the code regardless of the restrictions imposed by the client code, just to make sure we dont get a BSOD. 

The first thing we do is check the length of the buffer received from the Client  - to ensure that we have received the complete structure. For this we check the the `Length` parameter of the `Write` struct in the `Parameter` union (_phew_ - that was long). The `Parameter` union is an important component of `IO_STACK_LOCATION` which contains many different structures corresponding to different IRPs, which, in our case, is the `Write` structure. Coming back, we check the `Length` value of `Write` and in case we find that it is less than the size of the `ThreadData` structure, we set the appropriate `NTSTATUS` and jump to complete the I/O Request.

# The Client

With the driver done, we can take a look at the client which we would use to send messages to the driver itself. The pseudo-code for the client looks as such:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <Windows.h>

#include "..\BoosterDriver\BoosterCommon.h"

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
	if (argc != 3) {
		usage();
		return -1;
	}

	ULONG thread_id = (ULONG)atoi(argv[1]);
	int t_priority = atoi(argv[2]);

	// Check for thread id
    ...

	// Check for thread priority
    ...

	// Try to print current base thread priority
	...

	// Make a call to driver
	ThreadData t_data = {0};
	t_data.ThreadId = thread_id;
	t_data.TargetPriority = t_priority;

	HANDLE hDevice = CreateFile(L"\\\\.\\Booster", GENERIC_WRITE, 0, NULL, OPEN_EXISTING, 0, NULL);
	BOOL bRes = WriteFile(hDevice, &t_data, sizeof(t_data), &ret, NULL); 
	
	printf("[i] Priority changed from %d -> %d", t_data.CurrentPriority, t_data.TargetPriority);
	CloseHandle(hDevice);

	return 0;
}
```

Before we begin diving into `main()`, notice we include the `BoosterCommon.h` header which we had previously used in the Driver. We include this header file so we can have access to the `ThreadData` structure to have a uniform definition throughout. 

Looking into `main()`, we take in the target thread id and the priority we want to set it to from the command line. Then, after performing some checks to make sure the inputs are reasonable, we try to print the current thread's base priority.

Now comes the interesting part of the code. We initialize a `ThreadData` with the provided thread id and the target priority. This is the structure we will use to communicate with the Driver. 

Next, we open a handle to the `BoosterDriver` Device with:
```
HANDLE hDevice = CreateFile(L"\\\\.\\BoosterDriver", GENERIC_WRITE, 0, NULL, OPEN_EXISTING, 0, NULL);
```

The parameters to `CreateFile()` are important here:
- `lpFileName`: This indicates the [device naming co](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/defining-an-ms-dos-device-name)
